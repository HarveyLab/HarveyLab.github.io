Our goal is to understand fundamental principles for the function and 
organization of neuronal circuits in the mammalian cortex. We 
investigate how circuits perform computations involved in working memory
 and decision-making, especially in the context of spatial navigation.
</p>

<p class="bodyText">
Our approach is based on connecting properties of neuronal circuit 
function with behavior in the mouse. We utilize a variety of 
experimental methods to study activity dynamics in circuits and the 
relationship between circuit dynamics and architecture. Recently, we 
have initiated efforts to combine our experimental program with a 
program for computational and theoretical modeling. Together our 
approach emphasizes the dynamics and the mechanisms by which circuits 
perform computations (how does a circuit compute?) and, to a lesser 
extent, also aims to identify the computations performed in specific 
circuits (what does a circuit compute?).<span style="display: inline;" class="buttonShowMore" id="research">Read more</span>

Current work in the lab focuses in large part on the posterior parietal 
cortex (PPC), which is thought to be a key interface between sensory and
 motor information, including during working memory, decision-making, 
and navigation. Current projects emphasize a variety of questions. 
First, we aim to identify the fundamental activity patterns in the PPC 
during complex behaviors and the mechanisms by which these activity 
patterns are generated. We investigate PPC activity dynamics using 
measurements of activity in large neuronal populations during behavior, 
controlled manipulations of PPC activity to reveal key features of 
dynamics in PPC populations, and studies of how activity patterns 
develop during learning of new behavioral tasks. Second, we aim to 
understand how dynamics in the PPC arise from the underlying 
microcircuit architecture. We are developing approaches to map features 
of microcircuit architecture in neuronal populations that have been 
functionally characterized to aid understanding of circuit-level 
structure-function relationships. Third, we are studying how the PPC 
interacts with other brain areas in a larger network for complex 
computations. We utilize experiments to manipulate and monitor specific 
input and output pathways of the PPC.
</p>
<p class="bodyText">
Experiments in the lab are centered around behavioral, optical, and 
electrophysiological approaches. We train mice to perform perceptual 
decision-making and working memory tasks based on navigation through 
virtual reality environments. As mice perform tasks, we measure neuronal
 activity using sub-cellular resolution two-photon calcium imaging, 
large scale extracellular electrophysiology, and whole-cell patch-clamp 
recordings. We also probe circuit properties using simultaneous activity
 manipulations and activity measurements. In addition, we have a 
long-standing interest in developing novel approaches to study 
principles of neuronal circuit function and in establishing methods to 
expand the range of behaviors and computations that can be studied in 
the mouse model system. Currently, the lab is pursuing ways to combine 
data collected through experiments with the development of computational
 models, with the goal of establishing a tight experiment-theory loop.
</p>
<p class="bodyText">
The lab is composed of researchers with wide ranging and complementary 
skills and training. We aim to assemble a team that through intra-lab 
collaborative efforts will utilize interdisciplinary approaches and 
thinking to establish new ideas on the function of cortical circuits. 
Therefore, lab members with diverse backgrounds, including in experiment
 and computation, are highly valued.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="research">Read less</span>

	The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has an important role in many 
cognitive behaviours; however, the neural circuit dynamics underlying 
PPC function are not well understood. Here we optically imaged the 
spatial and temporal activity patterns of neuronal populations in mice 
performing a PPC-dependent task that combined a perceptual decision and 
memory-guided navigation in a virtual environment. Individual neurons 
had transient activation staggered relative to one another in time, 
forming a sequence of neuronal activation spanning the entire length of a
 task trial. Distinct sequences of neurons were triggered on trials with
 opposite behavioural choices and defined divergent, choice-specific 
trajectories through a state space of neuronal population activity. 
Cells participating in the different sequences and at distinct time 
points in the task were anatomically intermixed over microcircuit length
 scales (&lt;100 micrometres). During working memory decision tasks, the
 PPC may therefore perform computations through sequence-based circuit 
dynamics, rather than long-lived stable states, implemented using 
anatomically intermingled microcircuits.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="Harvey2012">Hide abstract</span>

	Spatial navigation is often used as a behavioral task in studies of the
 neuronal circuits that underlie cognition, learning and memory in 
rodents. The combination of in vivo microscopy with genetically encoded 
indicators has provided an important new tool for studying neuronal 
circuits, but has been technically difficult to apply during navigation.
 Here we describe methods for imaging the activity of neurons in the CA1
 region of the hippocampus with subcellular resolution in behaving mice.
 Neurons that expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3
 were imaged through a chronic hippocampal window. Head-restrained mice 
performed spatial behaviors in a setup combining a virtual reality 
system and a custom-built two-photon microscope. We optically identified
 populations of place cells and determined the correlation between the 
location of their place fields in the virtual environment and their 
anatomical location in the local circuit. The combination of virtual 
reality and high-resolution functional imaging should allow a new 
generation of studies to investigate neuronal circuit dynamics during 
behavior.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="Dombeck2010">Hide abstract</span>

	<p class="publicationAbstract">Hippocampal place cells encode spatial 
information in rate and temporal codes. To examine the mechanisms 
underlying hippocampal coding, here we measured the intracellular 
dynamics of place cells by combining in vivo whole-cell recordings with a
 virtual-reality system. Head-restrained mice, running on a spherical 
treadmill, interacted with a computer-generated visual environment to 
perform spatial behaviours. Robust place-cell activity was present 
during movement along a virtual linear track. From whole-cell 
recordings, we identified three subthreshold signatures of place fields:
 an asymmetric ramp-like depolarization of the baseline membrane 
potential, an increase in the amplitude of intracellular theta 
oscillations, and a phase precession of the intracellular theta 
oscillation relative to the extracellularly recorded theta rhythm. These
 intracellular dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate
 and temporal codes. The virtual-reality system developed here will 
enable new experimental approaches to study the neural circuits

	The activity of the ERK has complex spatial and temporal dynamics that 
are important for the specificity of downstream effects. However, 
current biochemical techniques do not allow for the measurement of ERK 
signaling with fine spatiotemporal resolution. We developed a 
genetically encoded, FRET-based sensor of ERK activity (the 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity reporter, EKAR), 
optimized for signal-to-noise ratio and fluorescence lifetime imaging. 
EKAR selectively and reversibly reported ERK activation in HEK293 cells 
after epidermal growth factor stimulation. EKAR signals were correlated 
with ERK phosphorylation, required ERK activity, and did not report the 
activities of JNK or p38. EKAR reported ERK activation in the dendrites 
and nucleus of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in brain slices after 
theta-burst stimuli or trains of back-propagating action potentials. 
EKAR therefore permits the measurement of spatiotemporal ERK signaling 
dynamics in living cells, including in neuronal compartments in intact 
tissues.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="Harvey2008_2">Hide abstract</span>

	In neurons, individual dendritic spines isolate N-methyl-d-aspartate 
(NMDA) receptor-mediated calcium ion (Ca2+) accumulations from the 
dendrite and other spines. However, the extent to which spines 
compartmentalize signaling events downstream of Ca2+ influx is not 
known. We combined two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging with 
two-photon glutamate uncaging to image the activity of the small 
guanosine triphosphatase Ras after NMDA receptor activation at 
individual spines. Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) triggered 
robust Ca2+-dependent Ras activation in single spines that decayed in 
approximately 5 minutes. Ras activity spread over approximately 10 
micrometers of dendrite and invaded neighboring spines by diffusion. The
 spread of Ras-dependent signaling was necessary for the local 
regulation of the threshold for LTP induction. Thus, Ca2+-dependent 
synaptic signals can spread to couple multiple synapses on short

	<p class="publicationAbstract">Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic
 transmission underlies aspects of learning and memory. LTP is 
input-specific at the level of individual synapses, but neural network 
models predict interactions between plasticity at nearby synapses. Here 
we show in mouse hippocampal pyramidal cells that LTP at individual 
synapses reduces the threshold for potentiation at neighbouring 
synapses. After input-specific LTP induction by two-photon glutamate 
uncaging or by synaptic stimulation, subthreshold stimuli, which by 
themselves were too weak to trigger LTP, caused robust LTP and spine 
enlargement at neighbouring spines. Furthermore, LTP induction broadened
 the presynaptic-postsynaptic spike interval for spike-timing-dependent 
LTP within a dendritic neighbourhood. The reduction in the threshold for
 LTP induction lasted approximately 10 min and spread over approximately
 10 microm of dendrite. These local interactions between neighbouring
