	<p class="personText">Akshay Jaggi received a B.S. in Computational Biology at Stanford University. There, he studied the role of immune molecules in synaptic plasticity with Carla Shatz’s lab. He next combined human neuroimaging and machine learning to study the ‘heart-brain axis’ in Barcelona. He then worked as a software engineer in the Datta Lab developing new methods for neuroethology. Akshay is now an MD-PhD student interested in using brain-machine interfaces to study learning and drift in neural populations. Outside of lab, Akshay loves cooking, djing, dance, and soccer.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="AkshayJaggi">Hide bio</span>
