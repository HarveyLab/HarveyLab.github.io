	<p class="personText">Charlotte received her BSc from Cologne University, Germany. During her PhD in the Hausser lab at University College London, UK, she used two-photon microscopy-guided electrophysiology to characterize the interactions between molecular layer interneurons, Purkinje cells and their excitatory afferents. In the Harvey Lab, Charlotte has been using optogenetics to study the necessity of neocortical areas in navigation-based decision-making tasks, as well as large-scale two-photon microscopy to measure cortical dynamics across different regions. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with her dog (or any dog really), playing tennis, and practicing and teaching yoga.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="CharlotteArlt">Hide bio</span>
