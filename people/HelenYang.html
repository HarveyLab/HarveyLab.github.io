	<p class="personText">Helen went to Northeastern University to study behavioral neuroscience, during which she completed two co-ops at the Harvey Lab helping to study population activity and circuitry during decision making. She liked the Harvey Lab so much (!) that she stayed on to be a research assistant, where she is continuing to learn about decision making as well as now memory processes. Outside of lab, Helen goes to the gym and likes to paint, curate spotify playlists, and eat with people.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="HelenYang">Hide bio</span>
