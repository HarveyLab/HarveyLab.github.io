	<p class="personText">Houman received his PhD in theoretical physics from SISSA in the beautiful city of Trieste. He joined the Diamond and Zoccolan labs as a postdoc and studied population coding in somatosensory and visual cortices of rats. He then joined the neural computational lab of Stefano Panzeri in Rovereto and worked on various computational and modeling aspects of information processing in the brain. In the Harvey lab, he is developing statistical and computational tools, such as copula-based models, to study high dimensional and complex data and is using these tools on different datasets in the lab. In his spare time, he watches Pingu with his wife.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="HoumanSafaai">Hide bio</span>
