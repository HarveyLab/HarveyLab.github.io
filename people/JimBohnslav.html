	<p class="personText">Jim graduated from Harvard University with an A.B. <i>cum laude</i> in neurobiology. As an undergraduate, Jim worked in Florian Engert's lab on the effects of neuromodulators on feeding behavior in zebrafish. He then worked as a research technician in Eugenia Chiappe's lab in Champalimaud on the visual behaviors that rely on small-object-detecting neurons in <i>Drosophila</i>. In graduate school, Jim has continued his interest in quantifying animal behaviors by developing computer vision techniques for behavior analysis in mice. He lives in Jamaica Plain with his wife Adaire and their (very cute) dog Stella.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="JimBohnslav">Hide bio</span>
