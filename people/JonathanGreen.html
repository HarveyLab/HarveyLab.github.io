	<p class="personText">Jonathan earned his PhD with Gaby Maimon at The Rockefeller University studying how flies build an internal sense of heading, and how they use this sense of heading to guide behavior. He is now working on new tools to study how cell types in mouse cortex interact during behavioral tasks. When he gets the chance, Jonathan likes to go on canoe trips and mountain treks.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="JonathanGreen">Hide bio</span>
