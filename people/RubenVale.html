	<p class="personText">Ruben received his MD from the University of Lisbon and his PhD from the University of Cambridge. He worked in Tiago Brancoâ€™s Lab, both at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology and at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, investigating how animals map the location of refuges in the environment, and how such memory controls anti-predatory defensive actions. He now studies the neural mechanisms that support mixing models of the world and ongoing observations to generate flexible yet experience-informed decisions. Outside the lab, Ruben loves spending time with his family and composing music.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="RubenVale">Hide bio</span>
