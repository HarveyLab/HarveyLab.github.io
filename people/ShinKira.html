	<p class="personText">Shin received his MD from Tokyo Medical and Dental University in Japan, and completed his PhD in the Shadlen lab at the University of Washington and Columbia University. For his thesis projects, he studied decision-making in monkeys and humans by using electrophysiology, psychophysics, and computational modeling. Now as a postdoctoral fellow in the Harvey lab, he studies navigation-based decisions in mice by using calcium imaging and optogenetics. He is especially interested in how the brain combines memory and sensory input to generate an appropriate action. Outside of lab, he likes playing with his little daughter and thinking about how cognitive functions develop through learning.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="ShinKira">Hide bio</span>
