	<p class="personText">Sofia completed her PhD in Joseph Paton's laboratory at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown in Lisbon, Portugal. During her PhD, Sofia used electrophysiology, optogenetics, and fiber photometry to study the contributions of striatal and midbrain dopamine neurons to animals' representations of time. In the Harvey lab, Sofia is combining large-scale two-photon calcium imaging with novel behavioral paradigms to understand how information arises and is maintained across the cortex during learning. Outside the lab, Sofia loves to explore on foot and by bike, to cook and eat delicious food, to make music, and not to take life too seriously.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="SofiaSoares">Hide bio</span>
