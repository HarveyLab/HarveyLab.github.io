	<p class="personText">Tarek received his bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago double majoring in Molecular Engineering and Neuroscience. He worked in the lab of Jason MacLean at UChicago on identifying features of neural network connectivity that allow flexibility while maintaining robust activity states, and in the lab of Philippe Renaud at EPFL developing microfluidic techniques for continuous time-locked measurements of concentrations of molecules in the brain. As a graduate student, he is interested in studying subtypes of neurons forming circuit motifs essential for navigational decision-making. Outside of lab, he enjoys walking around the city, trying new restaurants, and attempting to learn to play the guitar.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="TarekJabri">Hide bio</span>
