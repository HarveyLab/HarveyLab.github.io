	<p class="personText">Yasmine received her bachelor’s degree from Columbia University in Neuroscience and Philosophy. As an undergraduate researcher in Richard Axel’s lab, she worked on investigating the intergenerational inheritance of olfactory fear conditioning phenotypes. She then studied the impact of fear learning on neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium as a research assistant in Bianca Jones Marlin’s lab. As a graduate student, she is interested in characterizing the molecular changes that underlie network stability during learning and navigation. Outside of lab, Yasmine enjoys doing hot yoga, eating mochi donuts and going to concerts.<span class="buttonShowLess" id="YasmineAyman">Hide bio</span>
