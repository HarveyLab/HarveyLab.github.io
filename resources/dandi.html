	This is the dataset for Tseng et al, "Shared and specialized coding across posterior cortical areas for dynamic navigation decisions" in Neuron (2022). The dataset contains calcium activity of >200,000 neurons recorded from 6 different cortical areas in mouse posterior cortex L2/3 and L5 using two-photon imaging, including V1 and secondary visual areas, retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), while the mice were performing a flexible decision-making task based on rule-switching during virtual navigation. There are total 300 behavior + imaging sessions collected from 8 mice. Tutorial for loading the data: https://github.com/sytseng/Tutorial_notebook_for_Dandiset_000579.
